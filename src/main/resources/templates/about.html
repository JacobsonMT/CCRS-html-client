        <p><b th:text="${@siteSettings.title}">LIST-S2</b> (species specific) predicts the deleteriousness of amino acid mutations in protein sequences. First, it
            aligns (high Local identity Pair-wise Sequence Alignment, LPSA) the query sequence to all protein sequences in the UniProt Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL
            database and then it identifies the most relevant homologies based on their local identity to the query
            sequence around that position. And finally, it estimates the potential deleteriousness
            of mutations based on Taxonomy distance of species with variations to the query.</p>

        <p> Prediction scores are in the range [0 .. 1], where lower scores indicate more benign and higher indicate
            deleteriousness effect. We also included <a th:href="${@siteSettings.precomputedSite}" href="https://precomputed.list-s2.msl.ubc.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">precomputed predictions</a>
            for virtually all protein sequences of common taxa identified by their UniProt accession and Ensemble transcriptome id.</p>
