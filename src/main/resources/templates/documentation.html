        <p><b>LIST 2.0</b> predicts the deleteriousness of amino acid mutations in human protein sequences. First, it
            aligns (pair-wise alignment) the query sequence to all protein sequences in the UniProt Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL
            database and then it identifies the most relevant homologies based on their local identity to the query
            sequence around the position of the target mutation. And finally, it estimates the potential deleteriousness
            of mutations based on Taxonomy distance of species with variations to the query.</p>

        <p> Prediction scores are in the range [0 .. 1], where lower scores indicate more benign and higher indicate
            deleteriousness effect. We also included precomputed predictions of virtually all protein sequences
            identified by their UniProt accession and Ensemble transcriptome id.</p>
